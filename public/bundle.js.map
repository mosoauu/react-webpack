Multiple advantages for this particular use case.\n\t * In short, we need identical functionality to setState(), unless there is a prop defined\n\t * for the state key.  Also:\n\t *\n\t * 1. Single Renders\n\t *    Calling trySetState() in constructor(), componentWillMount(), or componentWillReceiveProps()\n\t *    does not cause two renders. Consumers and tests do not have to wait two renders to get state.\n\t *    See www.react.run/4kJFdKoxb/27 for an example of this issue.\n\t *\n\t * 2. Simple Testing\n\t *    Using a HOC means you must either test the undecorated component or test through the decorator.\n\t *    Testing the undecorated component means you must mock the decorator functionality.\n\t *    Testing through the HOC means you can not simply shallow render your component.\n\t *\n\t * 3. Statics\n\t *    HOC wrap instances, so statics are no longer accessible.  They can be hoisted, but this is more\n\t *    looping over properties and storing references.  We rely heavily on statics for testing and sub\n\t *    components.\n\t *\n\t * 4. Instance Methods\n\t *    Some instance methods may be exposed to users via refs.  Again, these are lost with HOC unless\n\t *    hoisted and exposed by the HOC.\n\t */\n\t\n\t\n\tvar getDefaultPropName = function getDefaultPropName(prop) {\n\t  return 'default' + (prop[0].toUpperCase() + prop.slice(1));\n\t};\n\t\n\tvar AutoControlledComponent = function (_Component) {\n\t  _inherits(AutoControlledComponent, _Component);\n\t\n\t  function AutoControlledComponent() {\n\t    var _ref;\n\t\n\t    var _temp, _this, _ret;\n\t\n\t    _classCallCheck(this, AutoControlledComponent);\n\t\n\t    for (var _len = arguments.length, args = Array(_len), _key = 0; _key < _len; _key++) {\n\t      args[_key] = arguments[_key];\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    return _ret = (_temp = (_this = _possibleConstructorReturn(this, (_ref = AutoControlledComponent.__proto__ || Object.getPrototypeOf(AutoControlledComponent)).call.apply(_ref, [this].concat(args))), _this), _this.trySetState = function (maybeState, state) {\n\t      var autoControlledProps = _this.constructor.autoControlledProps;\n\t\n\t      if (false) {\n\t        var name = _this.constructor.name;\n\t        // warn about failed attempts to setState for keys not listed in autoControlledProps\n\t\n\t        var illegalKeys = (0, _difference3.default)((0, _keys3.default)(maybeState), autoControlledProps);\n\t        if (!(0, _isEmpty3.default)(illegalKeys)) {\n\t          console.error([name + ' called trySetState() with controlled props: \"' + illegalKeys + '\".', 'State will not be set.', 'Only props in static autoControlledProps will be set on state.'].join(' '));\n\t        }\n\t      }\n\t\n\t      // pick auto controlled props\n\t      // omit props from parent\n\t      var newState = (0, _omit3.default)((0, _pick3.default)(maybeState, autoControlledProps), (0, _keys3.default)(_this.props));\n\t\n\t      if (state) newState = _extends({}, newState, state);\n\t\n\t      if (!(0, _isEmpty3.default)(newState)) _this.setState(newState);\n\t    }, _temp), _possibleConstructorReturn(_this, _ret);\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  _createClass(AutoControlledComponent, [{\n\t    key: 'componentWillMount',\n\t    value: function componentWillMount() {\n\t      var _this2 = this;\n\t\n\t      if (_get(AutoControlledComponent.prototype.__proto__ || Object.getPrototypeOf(AutoControlledComponent.prototype), 'componentWillMount', this)) _get(AutoControlledComponent.prototype.__proto__ || Object.getPrototypeOf(AutoControlledComponent.prototype), 'componentWillMount', this).call(this);\n\t      var autoControlledProps = this.constructor.autoControlledProps;\n\t\n\t      // Auto controlled props are copied to state.\n\t      // Set initial state by copying auto controlled props to state.\n\t      // Also look for the default prop for any auto controlled props (foo => defaultFoo)\n\t      // so we can set initial values from defaults.\n\t\n\t      this.state = (0, _transform3.default)(autoControlledProps, function (res, prop) {\n\t        var defaultPropName = getDefaultPropName(prop);\n\t\n\t        // try to set initial state in this order:\n\t        //  - default props\n\t        //  - then, regular props\n\t        //  - then, `checked` defaults to false\n\t        //  - then, `value` defaults to null\n\t        // React doesn't allow changing from uncontrolled to controlled components\n\t        // this is why we default checked/value if they are not present.\n\t        if ((0, _has3.default)(_this2.props, defaultPropName)) {\n\t          res[prop] = _this2.props[defaultPropName];\n\t        } else if ((0, _has3.default)(_this2.props, prop)) {\n\t          res[prop] = _this2.props[prop];\n\t        } else if (prop === 'checked') {\n\t          res[prop] = false;\n\t        } else if (prop === 'value') {\n\t          res[prop] = _this2.props.multiple ?

Multiple advantages for this particular use case.\n * In short, we need identical functionality to setState(), unless there is a prop defined\n * for the state key.  Also:\n *\n * 1. Single Renders\n *    Calling trySetState() in constructor(), componentWillMount(), or componentWillReceiveProps()\n *    does not cause two renders. Consumers and tests do not have to wait two renders to get state.\n *    See www.react.run/4kJFdKoxb/27 for an example of this issue.\n *\n * 2. Simple Testing\n *    Using a HOC means you must either test the undecorated component or test through the decorator.\n *    Testing the undecorated component means you must mock the decorator functionality.\n *    Testing through the HOC means you can not simply shallow render your component.\n *\n * 3. Statics\n *    HOC wrap instances, so statics are no longer accessible.  They can be hoisted, but this is more\n *    looping over properties and storing references.  We rely heavily on statics for testing and sub\n *    components.\n *\n * 4. Instance Methods\n *    Some instance methods may be exposed to users via refs.  Again, these are lost with HOC unless\n *    hoisted and exposed by the HOC.\n */\n\n\nvar getDefaultPropName = function getDefaultPropName(prop) {\n  return 'default' + (prop[0].toUpperCase() + prop.slice(1));\n};\n\nvar AutoControlledComponent = function (_Component) {\n  _inherits(AutoControlledComponent, _Component);\n\n  function AutoControlledComponent() {\n    var _ref;\n\n    var _temp, _this, _ret;\n\n    _classCallCheck(this, AutoControlledComponent);\n\n    for (var _len = arguments.length, args = Array(_len), _key = 0; _key < _len; _key++) {\n      args[_key] = arguments[_key];\n    }\n\n    return _ret = (_temp = (_this = _possibleConstructorReturn(this, (_ref = AutoControlledComponent.__proto__ || Object.getPrototypeOf(AutoControlledComponent)).call.apply(_ref, [this].concat(args))), _this), _this.trySetState = function (maybeState, state) {\n      var autoControlledProps = _this.constructor.autoControlledProps;\n\n      if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {\n        var name = _this.constructor.name;\n        // warn about failed attempts to setState for keys not listed in autoControlledProps\n\n        var illegalKeys = (0, _difference3.default)((0, _keys3.default)(maybeState), autoControlledProps);\n        if (!(0, _isEmpty3.default)(illegalKeys)) {\n          console.error([name + ' called trySetState() with controlled props: \"' + illegalKeys + '\".', 'State will not be set.', 'Only props in static autoControlledProps will be set on state.'].join(' '));\n        }\n      }\n\n      // pick auto controlled props\n      // omit props from parent\n      var newState = (0, _omit3.default)((0, _pick3.default)(maybeState, autoControlledProps), (0, _keys3.default)(_this.props));\n\n      if (state) newState = _extends({}, newState, state);\n\n      if (!(0, _isEmpty3.default)(newState)) _this.setState(newState);\n    }, _temp), _possibleConstructorReturn(_this, _ret);\n  }\n\n  _createClass(AutoControlledComponent, [{\n    key: 'componentWillMount',\n    value: function componentWillMount() {\n      var _this2 = this;\n\n      if (_get(AutoControlledComponent.prototype.__proto__ || Object.getPrototypeOf(AutoControlledComponent.prototype), 'componentWillMount', this)) _get(AutoControlledComponent.prototype.__proto__ || Object.getPrototypeOf(AutoControlledComponent.prototype), 'componentWillMount', this).call(this);\n      var autoControlledProps = this.constructor.autoControlledProps;\n\n      // Auto controlled props are copied to state.\n      // Set initial state by copying auto controlled props to state.\n      // Also look for the default prop for any auto controlled props (foo => defaultFoo)\n      // so we can set initial values from defaults.\n\n      this.state = (0, _transform3.default)(autoControlledProps, function (res, prop) {\n        var defaultPropName = getDefaultPropName(prop);\n\n        // try to set initial state in this order:\n        //  - default props\n        //  - then, regular props\n        //  - then, `checked` defaults to false\n        //  - then, `value` defaults to null\n        // React doesn't allow changing from uncontrolled to controlled components\n        // this is why we default checked/value if they are not present.\n        if ((0, _has3.default)(_this2.props, defaultPropName)) {\n          res[prop] = _this2.props[defaultPropName];\n        } else if ((0, _has3.default)(_this2.props, prop)) {\n          res[prop] = _this2.props[prop];\n        } else if (prop === 'checked') {\n          res[prop] = false;\n        } else if (prop === 'value') {\n          res[prop] = _this2.props.multiple ?
